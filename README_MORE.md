As an experienced Tech Lead and Full Stack Developer, I am proficient in various programming languages such as Ruby, Python, Golang, and JavaScript. I am skilled in designing, developing, and maintaining scalable web applications. 💻 

I have strong experience in RESTful and SOAP APIs, microservices, and cloud services such as AWS. ☁️ In my previous positions, I have built and maintained APIs and services in a variety of languages and frameworks.

I have experience building microservices architectures for complex systems, allowing for easier maintenance and scalability. In addition, I have worked with React, Node.js, and Ghost.js, where I have built custom content components for Ghost.js and plugins for Strapi. I am an advocate for using unit tests as a way to ensure high internal quality, which leads to better external quality. 🔬

I am also enthusiastic about hexagonal and clean architectures, which help to keep the codebase maintainable and adaptable to changes. I have experience with big data, data pipelines, and data processing using tools such as Spark, S3, DeltaTables, and Athena. 🌟
